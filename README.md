# Voice-Service

My version of a voice service (localized not cloud based)

// This will be true once I find a working offline voice interpreter for Python

// Or I may rewrite the whole thing in C++

Commands must be spoken in sequence, example: "order soda 1" if order was the command, soda was the object and 1 was the quantity.
